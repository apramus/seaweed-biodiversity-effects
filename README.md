`The authors request that you cite the above article when using these data or modified code to prepare a publication.`

The files contained by this repository are numbered sequentially in the order they appear in our data analysis and figure generation workflow, each of which is described below. To use our code, you will need the latest version of R installed with the `cowplot`, `dplyr`, `ecodist`, `egg`, `ggplot2`, `MASS`, `plyr`, `reshape2`, and `vegan` libraries, including their dependencies. 

## `1-ramus-thesis-data-cleaned.csv`

The cleaned dataset used to generate all analyses and figures presented in the paper. These data represent the yield of individual component species in mixtures and the plot-level sum of each treatment, for each variable, measured on a weekly basis over the course of the 12 week experiment. For complete methodology, see the corresponding article or [Ramus & Long (2016) *J Ecol*](https://doi.org/10.1111/1365-2745.12509). A brief description of each variable is given below. 

Field | Variable | Description

## `2-effects-on-secondary-production.R`

Here we focus on our most resolved data from the final 12 weeks of the experiment. Following the partition of Loreau & Hector (2001) *Nature*.

ANOVA

Code to replicate the primary analysis of ecosystem multifunctionality as presented in Ramus et al. (2017) PNAS. This code calculates multifunctionaity, fits candidate models using nonlinear least squares for each function individually, and generates the model selection table and corresponding figure presented in the paper.

## `3-effects-on-consumer-composition.R`

NMDS
PERMANOVA
Code to generate a model selection table for fitted nls models. This code works as a 'manual loop' for lack of a better description. Much of it is dedicated to combining and reorganizing information, although there are a few calculations.

## `4-bodiversity-effects.R`

Model selection table of fitted nls models generated by the code.

## `5 figure.png`

Figure generated by the code. Corresponds to Fig. 2 presented in the paper.

### (Notes for self)

The are a number of metrics that quantify the biodiversity-ecosystem funtioning and the most common the effect of biodiversity on plant productivity in terms of ‘relative yield’ – i.e. the ratio of species‐level productivity observed in a multi‐species mixture, relative to that in monoculture. Observed relative yield is then compared to a expected relative yield, in which the relative yield is proportional to the initial relative species abundance. Then, if the observed exceeds the expected, one can conclude that productivity per unit area is higher in mixtures than in average monocultures.

A major advantage of 'relative yield' related metrics is that one can partition them into different components and then use these components to summarize different characteristics of the relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning (**Loreau & Hector, 2001, Isbell et al., 2018**). The most common used of these metrics, is the *Loreau and Hector partition* that groups deviations between observed and expected yield into two componentsthe *‘selection effect’* and the *‘complementarity effect’* (**Loreau & Hector, 2001**). In *selection effect*, the presence of highly productive species species is responsible for higher productivity with greater diversity (**Aarssen 1997, Gorssman et al. 2017**). In other words, the biodiversity-productive relationship emerge just because sample plots have highly productive species (irrespective of plot diversity), and that the most productive species had more chance (*to be sampled*) of being included in the more diverse plots than in the less diverse plots. In *complementary effect*, complementary interaction between species related to functional differences are driving the biodiversity-productivity relationship (**Loreau & Hector, 2001, Gorssman et al. 2017**).

"Over the last two decades, empirical work has established that higher biodiversity can lead to greater primary productivity; however, the importance of different aspects of biodiversity in contributing to such relationships is rarely elucidated" (**Gorssman et al. 2017**).
