[![Figure_1.pdf](https://github.com/apramus/seaweed-biodiversity-effects/blob/main/figures-and-tables/Figure_1.pdf)](https://github.com/apramus/seaweed-biodiversity-effects/blob/main/figures-and-tables/Figure_1.pdf) Final observed structural equation model relating experimentally manipulated macroalgal richness to properties of both the macroalgae and associated invertebrate consumer communities (see Appendix S1: Figure S2 for the null hypothesized model). Arrows represent directed effects (i.e., the flow of causality from one variable to another). Standardized regression coefficients are shown next to the arrows in units of standard deviation of the mean, such that they can be compared fairly across response variables of differing units. Arrow widths are scaled by the standardized coefficients (see Appendix S1: Table S1). Marginal (fixed effects only) and conditional (fixed + random effects) R2 values are also reported for each response variable.

[![Figure_2.pdf](https://github.com/apramus/seaweed-biodiversity-effects/blob/main/figures-and-tables/Figure_2.pdf)](https://github.com/apramus/seaweed-biodiversity-effects/blob/main/figures-and-tables/Figure_2.pdf) Effects of macroalgal species identity and richness on metrics of primary and secondary production. Invertebrate (a) abundance, (b) dry biomass, and (c) taxonomic richness, and (d) macroalgal wet mass. Points are the time-averaged response of each replicate over the final 4 weeks (n = 5 for all treatments). Colors correspond to the seven experimental macroalgal treatments (see Data S1 for results of Tukeyâ€™s post-hoc analysis). Grey underlying boxplots represent the pooled response of all monocultures and polycultures, respectively. Result from one-way ANOVAs are shown near the margin of each panel.

[![Figure_3.pdf](https://github.com/apramus/seaweed-biodiversity-effects/blob/main/figures-and-tables/Figure_3.pdf)](https://github.com/apramus/seaweed-biodiversity-effects/blob/main/figures-and-tables/Figure_3.pdf) NMDS plot showing the composition of the invertebrate consumer community that colonized each experimental macroalgal treatment. Colors correspond to the seven experimental macroalgal treatments. Points represent the n-dimensional response of each replicate and were calculated from the mean consumer abundance after time averaging over the final four weeks. Shaded hulls indicate the multidimensional space occupied by the invertebrate community in each treatment (see Appendix S1: Table S2 for results of pairwise planned contrasts). Results of PERMANOVA based on the unweighted species abundances in each treatment are shown near the lower left margin (n = 5 for all treatments).

[![Figure_4.pdf](https://github.com/apramus/seaweed-biodiversity-effects/blob/main/figures-and-tables/Figure_4.pdf)](https://github.com/apramus/seaweed-biodiversity-effects/blob/main/figures-and-tables/Figure_4.pdf) The net biodiversity effect partitioned into its component complementarity and selection effects for each response variable (rows) in multispecies treatments. Invertebrate abundance (a), biomass (b), and taxonomic richness (c), and macroalgal wet mass (d). Colors correspond to the three biodiversity effect components as indicated in the legend. Points were calculated from time-averaged response of each replicate over the final 4 weeks (n = 5 for all treatments) and all values were square root transformed with the original sign preserved (Loreau and Hector 2001). Axis scales for biodiversity effect components are equivalent for each response variable (within rows), but not across response variables (among rows). Responses above the black line at 0 are positive whereas those below are negative (see Appendix S1: Table S3 for results of t-tests).
