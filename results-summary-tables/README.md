[![ANOVA-effects-on-partition.csv](https://github.com/apramus/seaweed-biodiversity-effects/blob/main/results-summary-tables/ANOVA-effects-on-partition.csv)](https://github.com/apramus/seaweed-biodiversity-effects/blob/main/results-summary-tables/ANOVA-effects-on-partition.csv) Results of one-way ANOVA analyzing whether biodiversity effect components differ among treatments for each response variable. Corresponds to an earlier version of Fig. 4 and is no longer presented in the revised version.

[![ANOVA-treatment-effects-on-response-metrics.csv](https://github.com/apramus/seaweed-biodiversity-effects/blob/main/results-summary-tables/ANOVA-treatment-effects-on-response-metrics.csv)](https://github.com/apramus/seaweed-biodiversity-effects/blob/main/results-summary-tables/ANOVA-treatment-effects-on-response-metrics.csv) Results of one-way ANOVAs (presented in the margin of each panel in Fig. 2) analyzing differences among macroalgal treatments for each response variable.

[![PERMANOVA.csv](https://github.com/apramus/seaweed-biodiversity-effects/blob/main/results-summary-tables/PERMANOVA.csv)](https://github.com/apramus/seaweed-biodiversity-effects/blob/main/results-summary-tables/PERMANOVA.csv) Results of PERMANOVA analyzing treatment differences in invertebrate community composition among macroalgal treatments (as presented in the margin of Fig. 3).

[![Table-S1.csv](https://github.com/apramus/seaweed-biodiversity-effects/blob/main/results-summary-tables/Table-S1.csv)](https://github.com/apramus/seaweed-biodiversity-effects/blob/main/results-summary-tables/Table-S1.csv) Estimates of regression coefficients and their standard errors (SE) from the structural equation model (Fig. 1). Standardized coefficients are shown in bold when significant (P < 0.05).

[![Table-S2.csv](https://github.com/apramus/seaweed-biodiversity-effects/blob/main/results-summary-tables/Table-S2.csv)](https://github.com/apramus/seaweed-biodiversity-effects/blob/main/results-summary-tables/Table-S2.csv) Pairwise planned contrasts for the effects of macroalgal treatment on invertebrate community composition (Fig. 3). Significant (P < 0.05) results from pairwise tests between treatments are bolded.

[![Table-S3.csv](https://github.com/apramus/seaweed-biodiversity-effects/blob/main/results-summary-tables/Table-S3.csv)](https://github.com/apramus/seaweed-biodiversity-effects/blob/main/results-summary-tables/Table-S3.csv) Results of t-tests analyzing whether components of the biodiversity effect (Fig. 4) differ from zero in each treatment. Probability values appear in bold when significant (P < 0.05).

[![Tukey's-HSD.csv](https://github.com/apramus/seaweed-biodiversity-effects/blob/main/results-summary-tables/Tukey's-HSD.csv)](https://github.com/apramus/seaweed-biodiversity-effects/blob/main/results-summary-tables/Tukey's-HSD.csv) Tukeyâ€™s post-hoc comparisons (HSD) for the effects of macroalgal treatment on plant and consumer response metrics (Fig. 2). Probability values are presented for pairwise comparisons between macroalgal treatments. Significant (P < 0.05) differences between treatment means appear in boldface.

[![t-tests-monos-vs-polys.csv](https://github.com/apramus/seaweed-biodiversity-effects/blob/main/results-summary-tables/t-tests-monos-vs-polys.csv)](https://github.com/apramus/seaweed-biodiversity-effects/blob/main/results-summary-tables/t-tests-monos-vs-polys.csv) Results of t-tests comparing monoculture vs. polyculture means for each response variable (presented as one-way ANOVA between two groups).
