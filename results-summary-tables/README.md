[![Table-S1.csv](https://github.com/apramus/seaweed-biodiversity-effects/blob/main/results-summary-tables/Table-S1.csv)](https://github.com/apramus/seaweed-biodiversity-effects/blob/main/results-summary-tables/Table-S1.csv) Estimates of regression coefficients and their standard errors (SE) from the structural equation model (Fig. 1). Standardized coefficients are shown in bold when significant (P < 0.05).

[![Table_S2.csv](https://github.com/apramus/seaweed-biodiversity-effects/blob/main/figures-and-tables/Table_S2.csv)](https://github.com/apramus/seaweed-biodiversity-effects/blob/main/figures-and-tables/Table_S2.csv) Pairwise planned contrasts for the effects of macroalgal treatment on invertebrate community composition (Fig. 3). Significant (P < 0.05) results from pairwise tests between treatments are bolded.

[![Table_S3.csv](https://github.com/apramus/seaweed-biodiversity-effects/blob/main/figures-and-tables/Table_S3.csv)](https://github.com/apramus/seaweed-biodiversity-effects/blob/main/figures-and-tables/Table_S3.csv) Results of t-tests analyzing whether components of the biodiversity effect (Fig. 4) differ from zero in each treatment. Probability values appear in bold when significant (P < 0.05).

Tukey’s post-hoc comparisons (HSD) for the effects of macroalgal treatment on plant and consumer response metrics (Fig. 2). Probability values are presented for pairwise comparisons between macroalgal treatments. Significant (P < 0.05) differences between treatment means appear in boldface.
